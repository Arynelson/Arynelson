# 👨‍💻 Ary Hauffe - Full-Stack Developer in the Making!

 Hi there👋

I am Ary Hauffe Neto, a professional transitioning to Fullstack development, with a degree in Sanitary and Environmental Engineering from UFSC. My background combines a foundation in technology – two years of Computer Science and engineering experience, bringing an analytical and structured perspective to problem-solving.
I am currently in the Oracle One training program and volunteer with Pipoca Ágil (an agile project simulation initiative).
My international experience, living in Brazil, the USA, Panama, and Italy, has granted me excellent adaptability, global thinking, and ease working in multicultural environments.
I am passionate about learning, facing challenges, and applying new technologies to create efficient and well-structured solutions.
